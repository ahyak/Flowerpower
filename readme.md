# Overview:

This 2-player memory game is a basic matching game to test each player's memory. In a deck of paired cards, each player will play a turn to find all the matching pairs of cards in the least amount of time. The player with the lowest time wins. After each player has completed the round, the winner of the game is announced.

# How to Play:

Players will enter their names in the name field and click the start game button.
Player 1 starts the game. The timer will start and the player has to match a deck of 16 paired cards.
Player one will complete their round once all the cards are matched. The timer will stop and round 2 will begin automatically after. Player two can now play their round. (The name of each player will be displayed on the top left corner to make it easier to know whose turn is it at all times).After both players have completed their rounds, the winner of the game will be announced.
